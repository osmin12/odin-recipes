       <h2>Mexicos Finest Seafood</h2>
       <P>Ceviche is a blend of spicy and lemon flavor seafood. With a blend of cucumber and other vegtables</P>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>Shrimp: I like to use medium shrimp and dice it small so everthing is more uniform in size.</li>
           <li>Limes: You'll need about two lemons</li>
           <li>Roma tomatoes: Other varieties of fresh garden grown tomatoes would be extra delicious too.</li>
           <li>Red Onions: Yellow onion may be substitued if needed.</li>
           <li>Clinantro: Feel free to add more to taste, or cut back a little for a milder flavor.</li>
           <li>Jalapeno: If you like it less spicy remove the seeds.</li>
           <li>Salt and pepper: Adds to taste</li>
           <li>Cucumber: Optional but adds a nice crunch. </li>
           <li>Avacodo: Not always included but i think its a must.</li> 
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil water in pot, fill bowl of ice water: Bring a pot of water to a boil. Meanwhile, fill up a medium bowl with ice water, set aside.</li>
            <li>Cook shrimp: Add shrimp to boiling water and let cook just until pink and opaque, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Drain, chill and chop shrimp: Drain shrimp in a colander then transfer to ice water to cool for a few minutes. Drain well then chop shrimp into small pieces (about 1/2-inch).</li>
            <li>Toss shrimp with fresh ingredients: In a medium bowl (you can use the same bowl) combine shrimp, lime juice, lemon juice, tomatoes, onion, cilantro, jalapeno pepper and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Marinate: Transfer to refrigerator and let rest 1 hour</li>
            <li>Add last few ingredients: Toss in cucumber and avocado and serve. Itâ€™s delicious with tortilla chips or over tostada shells.</li>
